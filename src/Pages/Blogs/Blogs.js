                <h4>Authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. The situation is like that of an airline that needs to determine which people can come on board</h4>

                <h4>Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users . It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more. Firebase Authentication makes it easier to get your users signed-in without having to understand the complexities behind implementing your own authentication system</h4>
